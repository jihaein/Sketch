Reflect on the process of making your first P5 Sketch. It can be brief, but do so in a narrative form. Some questions you could consider.  
What was challenging for you during this process?
What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
What are you proud of?

You should also incorporate your original planning drawing into your sketch, as well as any changes to that drawing, and any additional drawings you made.
